## How-To-Run

To install the game, download or clone the repository from GitHub to your machine. Open the downloaded or cloned repository on your device using a text editor. Launch the index.html file on your browser and begin playing. For more detailed instructions please visit: https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/.

## Instructions

The objective of the game is to successfully move the player icon to the water without colliding with any bug enemies. 

The game will provide you a Player, which you control, and multiple bug enemies. The player will always start on the grass. To move your player use the arrow keys on the keyboard. The player can move up, down, left and right. Please note, the player will not be able to move off the gameboard. 

Each bug enemy will move at a random speed across the paced block area of the gameboard. If your player collides with the bug, this will cause a game reset and not only will your player be placed back on the grass, but the speed of each bug will change. If your player successfully reaches the water, you have won the game and a notification will pop up alerting you so. The game will reset from there giving you the opportunity to play again.
